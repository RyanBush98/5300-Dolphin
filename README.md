## Sprint 1: Milestone 2 Rudimentary Storage Engine
Found under the Milestone2 tag, this milestone begins to create a relation manager by creating the basis of the heap storage engine, which uses a slotted page structure.<br> ![fig13](/assets/fig13.png)
<br><br>This storage engine will have three layers:
1. **DbBlock:** how records are stored and retrieved within the block
2. **DbFile:** that handles the collection of blocks that make up the relation, and also the creation, deletion and access to them. Uses BerkleyDB buffer manager for reading/writing to disk
3. **DbRelation:** presents the logical view of the table

Each layer corresponds to a concrete class:
1. **SlottedPage**
2. **HeapFile**
3. **HeapTable**

### Getting Started
In the directory where ```https://github.com/klundeen/5300-Dolphin.git``` is cloned
```bash
$ git checkout tags/Milestone2
$ make
```
